Players begin the game by starting the program. They are quickly asked for their name
and a character object is created with that name. From there, the story leads them to make
decisions about directions, answer riddles, and ultimately decide their own path. Most decisions
that the player makes have impacts on their stats increasing/decreasing health or attack. These
stats make it easier or harder to defeat the monsters that they inevitably encounter. When they
do encounter the monsters, they can fight or evade. If they choose to fight, a RNG will pick a
number in between 1 and the player’s attack and subtract that amount of health from the
monster. The same will happen with the monster’s attack and the player’s health. If a player
decides to evade, a RNG will pick a number between 1 and the monster’s speed. If this number
is less than 3 then the character will successfully evade without losing any health. If the evasion
fails then the player will be attacked by the monster, without dealing damage to the monster,
using the system described in the fight section. When the player reaches the end of the story by
defeating the Mythosaur, they are presented with choices that will determine one of four endings
that they can achieve. The impact of these choices is not known to someone playing the game
for the first time. There are many different paths, but ultimately, all the paths lead to the labyrinth
and ultimately the Mythosouar.
